    <p>The following are the graphs that I was able to create by viewing the Top 100 songs and counting the occurances of each genre by year:</p>
<h2>Top music genres of 2010</h2>
<p><img alt="Figure 1" src="https://juliangut2.github.io/Spotify-music-trends/images/Figure_1.png"></p>
<h2>Top music genres of 2011</h2>
<p><img alt="Figure 2" src="https://juliangut2.github.io/Spotify-music-trends/images/Figure_2.png"></p>
<h2>Top music genres of 2012</h2>
<p><img alt="Figure 3" src="https://juliangut2.github.io/Spotify-music-trends/images/Figure_3.png"></p>
<h2>Top music  genres of 2013</h2>
<p><img alt="Figure 4" src="https://juliangut2.github.io/Spotify-music-trends/images/Figure_4.png"></p>
<h2>Top music genres of 2014</h2>
<p><img alt="Figure 5" src="https://juliangut2.github.io/Spotify-music-trends/images/Figure_5.png"></p>
<h2>Top music genres of 2015</h2>
<p><img alt="Figure 6" src="https://juliangut2.github.io/Spotify-music-trends/images/Figure_6.png"></p>
<h2>Top music genres of 2016</h2>
<p><img alt="Figure 7" src="https://juliangut2.github.io/Spotify-music-trends/images/Figure_7.png"></p>
<h2>Top music  genres of 2017</h2>
<p><img alt="Figure 8" src="https://juliangut2.github.io/Spotify-music-trends/images/Figure_8.png"></p>
<h2>Top music genres of 2018</h2>
<p><img alt="Figure 9" src="https://juliangut2.github.io/Spotify-music-trends/images/Figure_9.png"></p>
<h2>Top music genres of 2019</h2>
<p><img alt="Figure 10" src="https://juliangut2.github.io/Spotify-music-trends/images/Figure_10.png"></p>
<p>Using this data we can see one interesting trend in which every single year the top genre has been <em>dance pop</em>, with an average of more than 20 of the top songs of each year being included in this genre. Dance pop in itself peaked in 2016, with in the later years it slowly became less relavant. Another interesting point to notice is that in a majority of the years the second most popular genre is either one variation of pop or hip-hop which tells us that in the 2010-2019 year span, there was a big culture around the genres of pop, dance pop, and hip-hop. At the beginning of the decade, we can note that dance pop began strong, giving us a little more than 40 of the top 100 songs were classified as dance pop, and as the end of the decade we can see this number dwindle it a little over 20. This can indicade a culture shift at the later point of the decade, with dance pop becoming a less prevalant genre, being slowly overtaken by pop, followed by melodic rap. One thing that can also be observed is the occurance of genres that are also not too popular anymore, in the earlier graphs we can see that the edm genre starts to the left of the midpoint of the graph, indicating that there was a market for edm music and I personally remember edm music being a big part of the early 2010's with artists such as Skrillex or Avicii hitting the main stage. However, by the last graph you can see the edm genre has slowly faded away and there is much less of an audience for it than at the beginning of the decade. Through insights like this we can see the importance of using graphs and music trends to see how culture changes overtime.</p>
<p>I chose to use a bar graph in order to visualize top genre's for the fact that it is easy to see the clear differences side by side in descending order of popular genres. One challenge was whether to include each indivual genre or to lump them together into broader groups for example whether to combine <em>Chicago Rap</em> with <em>Florida Rap</em> however, in order keep the integrity of the results and to show the  variation in music taste and genre I chose to keep the genres as they were. Gathering popular songs and analyzing them is alsoa a great method of analyzing and identifying trends. </p>
<p>One thing that changed how I approached analyzing this data is how I grouped the data, I grouped the data by the top 100 songs per year. I could have grouped the data by genre as opposed to the top songs per year, which is something that I thought about, grouping to see how many times one genre appeared throughout the decade, however, I came to the conclusion that showing the data in a year span was better to identify popularity and change over time, hence also the use of the bar chart to also show this change. Similar projects analyzing music on spotify also tended to use hotmaps to show other data points such as how energetic the music was and employed various years of data to prove the correlation it had to the amount of popularity it gained, however, I was more focused on the prevalance of genre and music rather than the attributes of the music.</p>
<p>Another interesting data point that I investigated was the top artists from the 2010-2019 era, which can be seen in the following graph:</p>
<p><a href="https://postimg.cc/mz3f4WSr"><img alt="topartists.png" src="https://i.postimg.cc/TwFRrRLn/topartists.png"></a></p>
<p>As you can see the top 3 must culturally significant artists of this time period are: Taylor Swift, Drake, and Calvin Harris, interestinglu enough we can continute to see these names now adays in 2024, specifically Drake and Taylor Swift. As we can also see from this graph within this time span, Taylor Swift has the most amount of popular songs, with a little over 20 songs total, while Drake trailed with around 17.5 songs, matching the same amount as Calvin Harris. Unsurprisngly, the next two artists were Rhianna and Ariana Grande who had the same amount of top songs sitting betwen 12.5 and 15 songs. Next we can see Bruno mars in the number 6 spot, with a little over 13 top songs, then we can see Maroon 5 with slightly over 10 songs and then for our last 3 spots we can see Post Malone, Jason Derulo, and Ed Sheeran all tied with 10 songs each. Through this graph we can conclude that in the 2010-2019 era Taylor Swift was the most culturally significanty artist. </p>
